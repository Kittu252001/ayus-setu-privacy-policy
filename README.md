Privacy Policy AyusSetu

Effective Date: October 19, 2025

Welcome to AyusSetu. Your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy explains how our application handles your information and your rights regarding it.

1. Introduction

AyusSetu (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We design our app to prioritize your safety, confidentiality, and peace of mind. We do not collect, store, share, or sell any personal information from our users.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be transparent: AyusSetu does not collect or store any type of personal or sensitive information. Specifically, we do not collect:

Personal identifiers (such as name, email address, phone number)

Health information or medical data

Device identifiers or location data

Payment or financial information

Contacts, photos, files, or any other user content

Usage analytics, behavioral data, or tracking information

All data processed within the app — such as appointment details, health metrics, or medical reports — remains securely on your device or is exchanged directly between you and the service provider (for example, a doctor or a wearable device) without being accessed by us.

3. No Data Storage or Cloud Sync

AyusSetu does not use cloud storage or external databases to store your data. Any information you enter or generate through the app is stored locally on your device or handled through third-party platforms based on your explicit consent.

4. Third-Party Services

If you choose to connect third-party devices or services (for example, Fitbit), any data shared is governed by their respective privacy policies. AyusSetu does not collect, view, or retain that data.

5. Children’s Privacy

AyusSetu does not knowingly collect or store any information from children under 13. Since no personal data is collected, the app is safe for users of all ages.

6. Security

We implement strong safeguards and design principles to ensure that no user data is collected, stored, or transmitted. Any data handled locally on your device remains under your control.

7. Your Rights

Since we do not collect any data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete. However, you are free to uninstall the app at any time to remove any locally stored information.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Any updates will be published here with a revised effective date.
